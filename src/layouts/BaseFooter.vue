                Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they purchase an eligible Mac
                or iPad at a Qualifying Location through 10/2/23. Only one Apple Gift Card per
                eligible Mac or iPad per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While
                supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of
                the Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad, but will be charged
                for all items in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice
                regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly
                Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting
                ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at
                checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the
                price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This will result in one ACMI installment plan
                over 12 months for the eligible iPad or Mac discounted by the instant credit, and a
                second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift
                Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans
                will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately,
                Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple Gift Card in the
                amount of the applicable discount off the eligible Mac or iPad. ACMI is subject to
                credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range
                from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 10, 2023. If you
                choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI-eligible purchase
                instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be
                subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not
                included in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the
                Apple Card Customer Agreement at
